# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund. The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions. This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

> **🚧 The project is evolving.** We're rebuilding it into a persistent, always-on AI hedge fund — a *fund* as a first-class entity you can backtest, paper-trade, and (opt-in) run live, with the investor agents reimagined as pluggable, backtestable "alpha models." Read the **[Vision →](VISION.md)** and the **[Roadmap →](ROADMAP.md)**.

Trades only happen when you ask: every run defaults to a simulated broker. The trading desk (below) can send the agents' orders to a persistent local paper book or to an Alpaca account.

## How to Install

```bash
pipx install aihf
```

(or `uv tool install aihf`, or `pip install aihf` into an environment of your choice)

Then run it from anywhere:

```bash
aihf
```

### API keys

The app asks for keys the first time it needs them and saves them to `~/.hedge-fund/.env` — nothing to configure up front. It needs:

- A [Financial Datasets](https://financialdatasets.ai) API key, for prices, fundamentals, and earnings.
- One model API key for the investor agents. Supported providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, xAI, Kimi, TypeSafe (Jev).

Keys exported in your shell always win over the saved file.

## How to Run

### Interactive app

```bash
aihf
```

With no arguments, this launches the interactive terminal app. Build a fund — pick stocks, strategies, rebalance cadence — or backtest a saved fund and watch its equity curve draw against its benchmark. Funds you build are saved as mandate files in `~/.hedge-fund/mandates/`.

### Non-interactive

Run one fund cycle from a mandate file. The full cycle record prints to stdout as JSON; a short human summary goes to stderr:

```bash
aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT
```

Run the same mandate with Jev after configuring `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`:

```bash
aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT --model jev-1.13.0
```

Backtest the mandate over history at its rebalance cadence:

```bash
aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT --backtest
```

A mandate is the desk — strategies, staff, risk, capital, cadence — and never names tickers; `--tickers` says what to point it at for this run.

### Trading desk (web UI)

```bash
aihf web --open        # http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

A local dashboard that lets the agents trade:

- **Preview trades**: the agents research your tickers and propose orders. Nothing is sent until you press **Approve & execute**.
- **Run & trade**: research and execute in one step.
- **Autopilot**: runs the fund every N minutes (default: the mandate's rebalance cadence), only while the market is open, and executes automatically or waits for your approval.
- **KILL**: stops autopilot, drops pending proposals, cancels open orders, and can optionally flatten every position.
- Live equity, P&L, positions, trade tape, activity log, a manual order ticket, each agent's conviction and written thesis, and an in-app key manager.

Brokers:

| Broker | What it is | Setup |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Local paper | A persistent simulated book in `~/.hedge-fund/paper/` | none |
| Alpaca paper | Real market fills with fake money | `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` (free at alpaca.markets) |
| Alpaca live | **Real money** | the same keys, plus `ALPACA_LIVE=1` when you launch |

The CLI can use the same brokers: `aihf mandate.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT --broker paper` (or `--broker alpaca`).
